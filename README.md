# Lovelystay test

Hi, thanks for your time reviewing this test. Short and sweet:

- Due to time constraints, I could not do 2 things: tests and pagination. Not that I don't know - I know tests, and I'm rusted at it - , but I have to deliver freelancers duties. The pagination is a query thing, organizing the state. It is missing but it's not the bulk of the work IMHO.
- I used Styled-Components, trying to use as best as I could the Atomic Design methodology. As a bonus, I added a theme switcher. The colors arent that pretty, but, hey, it works.
- Even though I did not delivered those 2 items, I used NextJs to further improve the project. And to re-learn the framework as well as I could. That was a decent amount of headache, since I only worked with past versions. But the project is better overall, I believe.
- Not asked for, but I added TypeScript as well. There are some "any" here and there, but I believe I've made my point showing that I can use it.

## To install

1 - clone this repo,
2 - go go the repo folder on your machine,
3 - open a terminal on the root of the folder,
4 - install the dependencies with yarn or npn, whatever floats your boat,
5 - run the script dev.
6 - access the port specified on the console. It's usually 3000 or 3001. So the address on your web browser of choice should be 'http://localhost:3000'
7 - search your user by the handler, click on the big card on the center of the page, see all the user's repos and, click on any of them to be redirected to it @GitHub.

## Thanks for the opportunity.

## <br/>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
